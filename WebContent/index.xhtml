	<ui:define name="contentTitle">Welcome to the OmniFaces Showcase application!</ui:define>

	<ui:define name="content">
		<p>
			Live examples of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/omnifaces/">OmniFaces</a> components and utilities
            can be tried out here. Check out them by the left menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			OmniFaces is a library for JSF 2.x that focusses on utilities that ease everyday tasks. An important design 
			goal will be to have as few dependencies as possible and to be minimally invasive. So far, it only requires
			JSF 2.0, EL 2.1 and Servlet 2.5 APIs which is already minimally available in a bit modern container serving
			a JSF 2.0 web application. As such, OmniFaces should principally integrate perfectly well with most other JSF 
			libraries. Even more, this showcase application uses PrimeFaces 3.2 which works perfectly fine together with
			OmniFaces.
		</p>
		<p>
			Characteristic of OmniFaces will be that it will not just be about components, but instead will have an 
			equally strong focus on providing utility classes for working with the JSF API from Java code, such as 
			<h:link value="Faces" outcome="/showcase/utils/Faces.xhtml" />
			and
			<h:link value="Messages" outcome="/showcase/utils/Messages.xhtml" />.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides components and utility classes, OmniFaces will include various general converters, validators and 
			Facelets tag handlers. These will range from 
			<h:link value="'all-or-none' validators" outcome="/showcase/validators/validateAllOrNone.xhtml" /> 
			to 
			<h:link value="converters which automatically convert Java models" outcome="/showcase/converters/SelectItemsConverter.xhtml" />
			for usage in e.g. a drop-down menu. There is also a 
			<h:link value="full ajax exception handler" outcome="/showcase/exceptionhandlers/FullAjaxExceptionHandler.xhtml" />
			which will automatically handle all ajax exceptions with the default <code>web.xml</code> error-page mechanisms.
		</p>
		<p>
			OmniFaces is a fully open source component library for JSF 2, and additionally this showcase application 
			itself is also fully open source. The showcase application project homepage is available at
			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/omnifaces-showcase/">code.google.com/p/omnifaces-showcase</a>.
			Full source code for all demos is available at 
			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/omnifaces-showcase/source/browse/">code.google.com/p/omnifaces-showcase/source/browse</a>.
